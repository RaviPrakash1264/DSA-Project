# My-DSA-Project
The project is based on the traffic that is produced in an airport
which involves the arrival of airplanes, the boarding of passengers,
and the departure of the airplane.
This involves the number of runways available in a particular airport
along with the number of gates available for the passengers to board
the airplanes from.
The project also covers the reservation that one does which involves
a few hours when a person can board the flight and which also
includes the domestic and international boarding within a few stops
available.
The runway works in a manner such that the flights that arrive first
are give priority in the queue and are arranged in such a manner.
The project tries to tackle the small problems which generally go
unnoticed like passenger travel time , air-craft wait time and etc, we
have tried to implement algorithms to solve the problems and have
incorporated various data structures.
